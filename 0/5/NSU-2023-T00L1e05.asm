# =================================
# LEAVE THIS PART OF THE FILE ALONE
# This is some initialisation code to load some values into the registers
	ldi r1,a
	ld r1,r1	# r1 = mem[a]
	ldi r2,b
	ld r2,r2	# r2 = mem[b]

# =================================
# INSERT YOUR ADDITIONAL CODE BELOW
# Executable instructions only
# No dc or ds pseudo-instructions
# Do not include a halt instruction: that has been done already (below)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	move r1, r3
	move r2, r1
	move r3, r2


# =================================
# LEAVE THIS PART OF THE FILE ALONE
# Do not change the next four instructions: they must be the last four
# instructions executed by your program.
    push r1
    push r2
    ldsa r0,0  # load the address of the current stack pointer into r0 for the robot
    halt       # Brings execution to a halt

# =================================
# DATA GOES BELOW
# We have set this up for you, but you will need to test your program by
# compiling and running it several times with different input data values
# (different values placed at addresses a and b)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

INPUTS>
# Input data (for testing) should be in the following memory cells:
a: dc 15
b: dc 14
