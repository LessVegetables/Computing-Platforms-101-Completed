# INSERT YOUR CODE BELOW
# Executable instructions only
# No dc or ds pseudo-instructions
# Do not include a halt instruction: that has been done already (below)

	ldi r1, a
	ld r1, r1
	ldi r2, b
	ld r2, r2
	
	and r1, r2
	
	ldi r3, c
	st r3, r2


# =================================
# LEAVE THIS PART OF THE FILE ALONE
# Do not change the next two instructions: they must be the last two
# instructions executed by your program.
    ldi r0, c    # Loads the address of your result into r0 for the robot
    halt         # Brings execution to a halt

# =================================
# DATA GOES BELOW
# We have set this up for you, but you will need to test your program by
# compiling and running it several times with different input data values
# (different bit-strings placed at addresses a and b)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

a:
  dc 0b01101011    # Input data (for testing) should be in this memory cell
b:

c:
  ds 1     # This memory cell is where the output will end up
